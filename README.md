# Helping Out

This repo is just a stash of all of the projects and files I've created to help answer other developers' questions. Sometimes you just need to experiment to see what works.

## Why?

Because it's good to have a record of these things. I recently found some projects I had used for this purpose, but they no longer had any context. What was the question that was asked? What, if anything, was learned by solving it? That information is lost to time. This repo will be a way to track that going forward, and will hopefully make it easier to find partially remembered questions and answers someday down the road.

## Structure

Any projects will be in a folder and will have a README.md file of their own. Standalone files that can contain the meta-info mentioned above in the comments will live in the root.
